    	\item \code{read.DICOM.RT()} failed when calculating DVHs from dose grid
    	\item \code{calculate.DVH()} subroutines improperly ignored \code{dose.unit} parameter input
    	\item DVHs containing plan sum data without prescription dose/isodose information were considered as invalid DVH objects.
    	\item DVH plotting using \code{plot(..., plot.type="ttest")} or \code{plot(..., plot.type="wilcox")} improperly displayed relative volume information along an absolute volume y-axis when parameter \code{volume="absolute"} was specified.
    	\item DVH plotting using \code{plot(..., plot.type="wilcox")} displayed inaccurate confidence intervals.
     }
  }

  \subsection{OTHER UPDATES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Updated behavior of \code{wilcox.test(..., paired=TRUE)} to return parameter \code{"estimate"} as the true median of pairwise differences in lieu of the statistical (pseudo)median calculated by wilcoxon signed-rank test.

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.7}{

  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item New class \code{zDVH} (along with relevant methods) to store one or more axially-segmented and calculated dose-volume histograms. The class otherwise contains all elements of the \code{DVH} class and is largely interchangeable with other \code{DVH} objects.
      \item New plot functionality for axial dose-volume histogram displayed from one or more \code{zDVH} objects.
      \item New method for \code{compareStructures()} ("DSC") which calculates Dice similarity coefficients between pairs of structures.

      \item \code{LQE()} now supports fractionation specification in either dose per fraction or total number of fractions (parameter \code{N} was introduced for this purpose).
   }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fixed structure import using \code{read.DICOM.RT()} for structure sets not mapped to a DVH present within the dose file (previously returned empty structures instead of populating the structures with their respective vertices).
      \item Fixed fatal error in DVH extraction from dose grid data (previously occurred when one or more points were duplicated within a structure).
      \item Input of empty directly previously caused fatal error in \code{read.DICOM.RT()}
      \item \code{t.test()}, \code{wilcox.test()} and methods employing this functionality (e.g. \code{plot(..., plot.type="ttest")}) previously failed if any elements in DVH list were empty.
      \item \code{sum()}, \code{mean()}, \code{median()}, \code{mad()}, \code{var()}, and \code{sd()} previously failed if any elements in DVH list were empty.
      \item Fixed integral dose calculation, which previously returned values that were inadvertently scaled by the dose bin width.
      \item Fixed validity checking of \code{DVH} objects containing a single dose-volume value.
      \item x-axis improperly specified dose units as "cGy" when plotting DVHs in units of "Gy". 
      \item Isoeffective dose calculation using \code{LQE()} was previously inaccurate due to incorrect implementation of the Withers isoeffective dose formula -- this has now been corrected.
      \item Previously improper handling of \code{type} specifier in \code{read.DVH()} where specified type was not provided and list of input files was longer than length 6.
    }
  }

  \subsection{DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT}{

      \item Removed unused package dependency on \pkg{Rcpp} (future releases may reincorporate this dependency in order to support C++ implementations of various algorithms).
    }
  }

  \subsection{OTHER UPDATES}{

      \item New functions to support interaction with \code{RTdata} class.
   }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Updated DVH parameter extraction to return maximal dose in cases where extrapolated dose exceeds actual maximum dose.
      \item DVH methods previously failed without graceful warning or exit in cases where prescription dose was not specified (e.g. plan sum DVH data from Eclipse).
    }
  }

  \subsection{DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT}{
    \itemize{
      \item Method \code{compareStructures(..., method="grid")} has been renamed to \code{compareStructures(..., method="axial")}. Code still supports call using "grid" method, however it now generates a warning to use the preferred "axial" method.
    }
  }

  \subsection{OTHER UPDATES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added plotting support for \code{structure3D} objects without pre-specified triangulation; previously a call to \code{plot()} would generate an empty plotting window.

  }

 }

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.3}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
    	\item New methods for \code{sum()} implemented to handle DVH data (assumes *non-overlapping* structures); it can be used to calculate total dose from multiple independent structures (e.g. paired/bilateral lungs or kidneys).
    	\item New function \code{gEUD()} to calculate generalized equivalent uniform dose values from \code{DVH} and \code{DVH.list} objects.
    	\item New function \code{LQE()} to perform linear quadratic extrapolation for iso-effective dose conversion among \code{DVH} and \code{DVH.list} objects with different fractionation.
    	\item Extended \code{read.DVH()} function to import CadPlan files (for achival/historical data).
    	\item Extended \code{read.DVH()} function to import multiple files simultaneously, if desired.
    	\item Expanded functionality of DVH parameter access; now a user may specify output type in parentheses (e.g. \code{DVH["V20Gy(cc)"]}).
   }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Updated \code{plot(..., plot.type="grouped")} to ensure that \code{multiplier} contains a positive value (previously inappropriate negative value would result in a plotting error).

  }

  \subsection{DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT}{
    \itemize{
      \item The \code{center} parameter in the DVH-specific \code{plot(..., plot.type="grouped")} function is no longer supported. Instead, the parameter is now implicitly determined from the \code{width} parameter (e.g. \code{center="mean"} when \code{width="sd"}).
    }
  }

  \subsection{OTHER UPDATES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added version requirement for \code{oro.dicom} package (must be >= 0.4.1) in order to appropriately import high-resolution structure sets.

    \itemize{
      \item New function \code{read.DICOM.RT()} to import 3-dimensional structural information from one or more DICOM-RT files.
      \item New class \code{structure3D} to store 3-dimensional information encoding a structure.
      \item New functions to support interaction with \code{structure3D} class.
      \item New class \code{structure.list} to store a list of \code{structure3D} objects.
      \item New functions to support interaction with \code{structure.list} class.
      \item New function \code{compareStructures()} to assess similarities and differences among two or more\code{structure3D} objects within a \code{structure.list}.
   }
  }

  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item For \code{plot(..., method="grouped", width="IQR", center="mean")}, shading offset was previously incorrect, resulting in improper plotting.
      \item For \code{plot(..., method="grouped", width="quantile", center="mean")}, shading offset was previously incorrect, resulting in improper plotting.
      \item Fixed error causing overwrite of slot \code{structure.volume}, preventing proper creation of \code{DVH} objects.
      \item Fixed \code{names<-} function for \code{DVH.list} class which had erroneously prevented lookup of newly assigned names
    }
  }
  
  \subsection{OTHER UPDATES}{
    \itemize{
      \item RadOnc.RData file updated to include example 3-dimensional structural data (\code{cord}, \code{mandible}, \code{teeth}).
      \item Implemented coercion from class DVH to DVH.list, \code{as(..., Class="DVH.list")}.
